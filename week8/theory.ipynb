    "## Exercise 1: AdaBoost and VC-dimension\n",
    "In this exericse, we will investigate the VC-dimension of voting classifiers and argue that one has to be careful with the number of iterations of boosting to guarantee good generalization performance with high probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will consider is one-dimensional, i.e. a single feature. Our weak learner is decision stumps, i.e. a base hypothesis $h$ can be specified by a splitting value $v$, and two leaf values $a, b \\in \\{-1,1\\}$. Given a one-dimensional feature vector $x = (x_1)$, the hypothesis $h$ returns $a$ when $x_1 \\leq v$ and it returns $b$ otherwise. We let $H$ denote the set of all such decision stumps, i.e. $H$ is the set of base hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VC-dimension of base classifier\n",
    "1. Show that the VC-dimension of $H$ is $2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VC-dimension of voting classifiers\n",
    "Let $C$ be the class of all voting classifiers over $H$, i.e. $C$ consists of all hypotheses of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\textrm{sign}(\\sum_{h \\in H} \\alpha_h h(x))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "with $\\sum_{h \\in H} \\alpha_h = 1$ and $\\alpha_h \\geq 0$ for all $h$. We will show that $C$ has infinite VC-dimension. To do so, we will argue that for any size $n$, there is a set of $n$ points $x_1,\\dots,x_n$ in 1d that can be shattered, i.e. for any labeling $y \\in \\{-1,1\\}^n$ of the $n$ points, there is a hypothesis $g$ in $C$ such that $g(x_i)=y_i$ for all $i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider the simple point set $x_i = i$, i.e. $n$ evenly spaced points on the line. Let $y \\in \\{-1,1\\}^n$ be any labeling of the $n$ points. We need to show that there is a hypothesis $g \\in C$ that has $h(x_i)=y_i$ for all $i$. To do so, we will use the fact from the lecture that if our base learner guarantees that there is some $\\gamma > 0$, such that for every probability distribution $D$ over $x_1,\\dots,x_n$, the base learner produces a hypothesis $h \\in H$ such that the weighted $0-1$ loss satisfies $L_D(h) = \\sum_{i=1}^n D(i)1_{h(x_i) \\neq y_i} \\leq 1/2-\\gamma$, then running AdaBoost for $(\\ln n)/(2 \\gamma^2)$ iterations produces a voting classifier $f$ with $0$ error on $x_1,\\dots,x_n$.\n",
    "1. Assume we have some probability distribution $D$ over $x_1,\\dots,x_n$ and assume that there is a hypothesis $h \\in H$ with $L_D(h) \\leq 1/2-\\gamma$. Show how to modify the algorithm from the Decision Tree lecture that computes decision stumps, such that it is guaranteed to output a hypothesis $h'$ with $L_D(h') \\leq 1/2-\\gamma$.\n",
    "2. Argue that for any probability distribution $D$ over $x_1,\\dots,x_n$, there is a hypothesis $h \\in H$ with $L_D(h) \\leq 1/2 - 1/(2n)$. Hint: Consider hypotheses where the splitting point is right before and right after the point $x_i$ with largest probability $D(i)$.\n",
    "3. Use the above to conclude that there is a hypothesis $g \\in C$ with $g(x_i) = y_i$ for all $i$."
